# Building Palindromes

## My Solution

For some reason, using the Kickstart service, my solution generates the
correct output but time elapses. However, when I run it with the maximum
sizes listed in the description (string size, N = 10^5 and questions, Q = 
10^5), using all random data, I always get about 24 seconds. And that's on my 
several year old Windows laptop. Constant time, though, so good enough for
me. :)
